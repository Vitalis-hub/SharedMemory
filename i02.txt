When he went back to the country at the beginning of June, he went
back also to his usual pursuits. His agriculture, his relations with
the peasants and the neighbors, the care of his household, the
management of his sister's and brother's property, of which he had the
direction, his relations with his wife and kindred, the care of his
child, and the new beekeeping hobby he had taken up that spring,
filled all his time.
